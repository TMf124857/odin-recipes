        <li>1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls</li>

        <li>8 teaspoons honey mustard</li>
        
        <li>8 slices deli ham</li>
                
        <li>8 slices sharp Cheddar cheese, cut in half</li>
                
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an air fryer basket with parchment paper and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unroll crescent rolls. Spread each roll with 1 teaspoon honey mustard and add 1 folded deli ham slice and 1 slice Cheddar cheese. Roll crescents up, starting with the widest side, tucking and pinching the ends. Set into the prepared air fryer basket, making sure they don't overlap. You might have to cook them in batches.</p></li>
        <li><p>Air-fry until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Pull basket out and carefully flip crescent rolls. Air-fry until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 4 minutes.</p></li>
